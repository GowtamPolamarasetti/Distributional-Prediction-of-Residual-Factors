# Deep-Portfolio-Optimization-via-Distributional-Prediction-of-Residual-Factors
### This project implements a quantitative trading strategy that utilizes deep learning to optimize a portfolio of 10 major US stocks (including AAPL, MSFT, and TSLA). The workflow begins by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to remove common market trends and extract "residual" factors for each asset. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with quantile regression loss is then employed to predict the probability distribution (specifically the 5th, 50th, and 95th quantiles) of these future residuals. Finally, the strategy constructs a portfolio by dynamically allocating weights to assets based on their predicted signal-to-noise ratio, achieving an annualized return of roughly 17.8% with a Sharpe ratio of 0.78 in the backtest.
